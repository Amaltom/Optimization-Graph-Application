Objective
To apply the concepts from Network Theory, Machine Learning and Optimization, and draw insights that would assist a person answer the following questions
1) How to minimise the spending while visiting a set of predefined criteria of restaurants?
2) What is the shortest path in which I can visit all the restaurants?
3) If I plan to visit a particular restaurant, are there any other restaurants that I can visit
on the way to minimise the travel time covering multiple restaurants?
